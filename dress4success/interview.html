       <h2 class="start">Why did you start YouTube?</h2>
       <p class="start">I started upload on YouTube to show Japanese people that there are so many beautiful cities and landscapes in the world. There are many people who want to travel but cannot. I upload videos with the intention of going there for them.</p>
       <h2 class="how">How is it being on YouTube?</h2>
       <p class="how">It is difficult to make videos for everyone to watch. I make videos with the intention of valuing the people who watch them every day, not to acquire new ones, but I still want to see the number of subscribers increase.</p>
       <h2 class="goals">What are your goals as a YouTuber?</h2>
       <p class="goals">I have no goals. I also upload videos to YouTube for my own memories, so I would like to make videos that remind me of memories. I can also explain to my friends about the places I have been with my videos, so I don't have any specific goals. I would like to make money with YouTube as a side job, but it is difficult.</p>
       <h2 class="germany">You are going to Germany as a working holiday, why did you choose Germany?</h2>
       <p class="germany">I originally wanted to go to graduate school, so I decided to go to Germany, considering the financial aspect. And I chose Germany for soccer, study, language, security, and overal consideration.</p>
       <h2 class="feel">How did you feel about visiting Germany?</h2>
       <p class="feel">I didn't understand German at all at first, but I wasn't that worried. Even if it was just a cityscape, at first I was excited to see European cities. Now it is commonplace, but I still think it is beautiful when I see the Rhine River.</p>
       <h2 class="future">What are your future goals as a YouTuber?</h2>
       <p class="future">The first step is to get 1,000 subscribers. Then, I want to upload 100 videos to YouTube. Continuity is something I value very much, so my goal is to never stop.</p>
       <h2 class="plans">What are your future plans?</h2>
       <p class="plans">I want to visit many different countries. I have only been to 5 or 6 countries and would like to go to at least 10. I want to enjoy life. I want to live my life while thinking carefully about what I want to do in the future.</p>
       <h2 class="college">What did you work hard for when you were a college student?</h2>
       <p class="college">Doing the things you take for granted. I did my best to do the basic things of attending classes and studying hard. I made sure to take classes so that I could get something out of them, even if they didn't seem interesting. I spent my college years trying to find something I liked to do.</p>
       <h2 class="sports">Did you play any sports?</h2>
       <p class="sports">I worked on almost all the sports. It was a great experience and very good because I was able to get involved with many different people, and I also learned what I was good at and what I was not good at. I tried to challenge myself in everything I did. Especially soccer is a sport I have continued since kindergarten and I like it very much.</p>
