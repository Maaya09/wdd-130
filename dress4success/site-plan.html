    <p class="brainstorm">Many people watch Youtube. When Youtubers with unique personalities are posting interesting videos on a daily basis, we sometimes wonder what they are like and want to know his/her profile. In such cases, it would be very useful to have a site that compiles profiles of Youtubers, many of whom not only register videos on Youtube but also engage in various other activities. So this site would allow us to find out what they are doing and what goods they are selling. This site will definitely make you like the person more. What visitors expect from my site is to get a lot of information that they didn't know they could get from Youtube. I think that visitors will be happy to have more information and Youtubers will be happy to have more subscribers, so it will be a win-win situation. So I think this site is very useful.

        We will need a lot of information to create the site. The first step is the profile of the person to be introduced. I need to find out details about the person that can only be found on the site. I will do not just write information, but also pay attention to design, such as how to attract viewers. Second, I will want to include photos and videos taken by the person. It is hard to imagine what the person is like with just text. Therefore, I will include some videos and photos that the person has actually posted.
        
        My page will be simple and easy to understand. I will try to make the site based on a single color instead of using many colors. Color is very important to people, so I will try to put a lot of information on the site, but I will try not to make it difficult to read. I will direct people to my site instead of other sites by putting the information they want to know in an easy-to-understand way. And by interviewing the person in question, I will provide information that cannot be found elsewhere. I would like to make the interview interesting and detailed as well as informative.</p>
