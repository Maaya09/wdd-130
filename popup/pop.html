                <p>I am from a small town in Japan and used to go out and hung out with my friends when I was little. When I was in junior high school, I went to Korea to study English and learned the fun of English there. Then, when I was in high school, I went to the U.S. and decided to go to college in the U.S. I am currently studying computer science at an American university.</p>
